Components
    * Should never manage the outermost margin. Let the parent element that renders the component deal with that.
    * Components should manage everything within themselves starting from their outermost element.


Mobile -> Tablet -> Desktop Sizes
    * Home page
        * Smaller screen forces top to bottom layout
        * As the screen gets larger then the layout changes to a left to right layout
				* Ultimately, if something looks too big, then change design to be left to right.
    * Article pages
        * Content
			* max-width 1280 px
			* Responsive layout that works from mobile to desktop
        * Components underneath the article might scale differently depending on the screen size, but
		   that would be considered not the content. So it should follow a similar rule to the home page notes.
